# Automated Data Cleaning Pipeline

Welcome to the Automated Data Cleaning Pipeline project! 🎉 This project provides a web interface for uploading CSV files, which are then processed and cleaned according to your specifications. 

## Overview

The project consists of two main components:

1. **HTML File**: Provides a user interface for uploading CSV files.
2. **Python Script**: Processes the uploaded files and performs data cleaning operations.

### HTML Interface

The HTML file creates a web page with the following features:

- A **gradient background** for a modern look 🎨
- A **big title** for clear identification 📜
- An **upload form** for CSV files 📂
- A **GitHub profile link** for additional information 🐙
- A **funny note** about data security 😂

Here’s how the HTML file looks:

#### Key Features:

- **Multicolor Gradient Background**: A vibrant gradient using colors `#0052DA`, `#436F7`, and `#6FB1FC` 🌈
- **File Upload**: Allows users to upload CSV files for cleaning.
- **Responsive Design**: The page adapts to various screen sizes 📱💻

### Python Script

The Python script handles the file processing and cleaning. It performs tasks such as:

- **Reading CSV Files** 📊
- **Removing Duplicates** 🗑️
- **Handling Missing Values** 🧹
- **Generating Cleaned Files** 💾

You can find the Python script in the project directory and run it to process uploaded files.

### Note

Your data is safe—because we’re too broke to afford a server! Trust us, we couldn’t store it even if we wanted to. 😅
